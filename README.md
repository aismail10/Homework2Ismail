#MIS Assigment 2: Prototype Development and Research for Web Application


1.**Complete a Competitive Analysis**


-**First Website.** -:

https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/weather/interactive-map

This website showâ€™s an interactive map of the radar of each state and these aspects Radar, Infrared Satellite, Hourly wind, Past 24 hr. 
Precipitation,  24 hour Surface forecast, Crop moisture, Palmer drought index, GDD contour, Soil temp. 
It gives a comprehensive look at what the weather conditions are like relevant to agriculture.
The elements this website provides is very important to the famers to look at on the daily. 
This website has many file patches that change the url when pressing
This website uses an interactive and uploading real time weather visualization and interactive.
It uses JavaScript for dynamic weather visualization and interactive. 

-**Second Website.** -:

https://www.weather.gov/

This website delivers a weather predictions, alerts, and other weather related information across the United States of America. 
The website provides a simple a user friendly and exentsive design, it makes it easiers for users to access easily for local forecast,serve weather alerts, and for eductional resources. 
URL elements like "?" and "#" are used to navigate around the website without refreshing it and manage content dynamically.
A technical examination indicates a specialized solution for meteorological data presentation, with an emphasis on performance and accessibility, and no obvious use of front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap for the user interface.
Users can get real time respones because a Javascript is used actively and making users to get real time data updates. 

-**Third Website.** -:

https://www.visualcrossing.com/agriculture-weather-data#:~:text=Farmers%20can%20use%20weather%20data,adjust%20their%20irrigation%20schedules%20appropriately.

This website delivers regrading planting, crop care, harvesting, livestock care, and marketing,and letting farmers may benefit from this website to get an accurate agriculture weather. 
It show's when is the right time to grow crops for an accurate planning and mangement, the soil tempature, and soil mositure. 
The website has a easy layout weather API so users can get forecast and historical data. 
Although the explanation of the website does not go into detail about the intricacies of the underlying code or frameworks (like Bootstrap), it looks that the site makes use of contemporary web technologies to show data in an accessible and user-friendly manner.

2. **Complete GitHub Repository Research.**

- **First GITHUB Repository Research** - 

https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS

I really like how this README it shows there are volunteers that built a app for farmers to plan their farming and giving them the best options on when is the best times to do so.
The application also gives farmers a way to keep their history of what they are perfoming and gives them a farming plan with real time data updates and which area is the best to farm in. 
They show Michael Stenta is the maintains the app and also includes everyone that particpated on this project. 
The README gives a great explantion of what the app does and also links the website to the README, to show you where exactly you can access their information. 
-**Second GITHUB Repository Research**:

https://github.com/brycejohnston/awesome-agriculture

This Github seemed way more indepth,Bryce Johnson show's a very advanced README explaining all what he done with this agriculture website. 
The README has a lot of various different attributes he has done to make it easier for who ever is looking at his README to see the various attributes he has done. 
It's show's a database that is recording crops & keeping information about them using an API. This website is very useful for farmers to keep data recorded for when they are farming and to understand when each plant needs to be harvest or needs more attention. 
The way Bryce Johnson made this README is very easy and simple to identify what exactly he was doing for each set of that wesbite, he makes it easy to read and user friendly.He explains which kind of code language he uses for each one of the attributes he put into the README. 
This is important for farmers that are trying to store information and understand certain trends that are happening with their farm's. 

4. **Document with a README**
-**Project Overview**
My project is showing a basic HTML prototype, it provides a new introduction of what exactly this website will be.The website provides a simple javascript presenting the exact time and date, this will be very helpful in the future with giving a precise respone of how the weather for farmers. It provides the humidity of cities. 
It show's a descriptive range of when certain fruits and vegetables show be grown in which humdity.For an example an apple should be grown in 40%-60% humidity, this data will be important for farmers to know when is the right time to grow their apple. 
The website does feature a search fruits section that directs you to another page. This will be helpful for farmers to get to accurate information about when it's smart to crop certain fruits and vegtables.
The wesbite is still in the beginning stage so it's nothing complex or has a lot of JavaScript functions, it's very basic. 

-**Page description**
The project has a very simple conceptual and technical aspects. This is one JavaScript code that displays a data & time which is supposed to help farmers get the accurate weather at the precise manner.
The project is still in the beginning stages there isn't much aspects about the website.The website still needs a lot of JavaScript to give a precise accurate weather, this will help farmers to grow their crops. 
It has a bootstrap function that you can press and you can search certain fruits. It's still not fully functionable that will be improved to search the fruits & vegtables and see when is the right time to grow.

-**Future Enchnanchments-**
The project needs a lot of improvments, after seeing the different website we were researching it show's they use a lot of JavaScript and uses API to give precise and accurate weather. 
This helps farmers get the best outcome for their crops,this is very important to work on.
It's needs more development to improve the look and organize the website to make look more cleaner and more easier to function. 
I want to improve the the press link tool i want it to be able to show various fruits and vegtables, I want it to show what's the best time to grow and when is the best month to grow. This is very important for my site.

**Reflection on Resources**
I was having trouble at first with HTML, I never built a website before and it's way than what I do in my other classes that I have taken in my Managment Information System classes.
I was a bit afarid and little bit stressed about what do and what was expect from me. It helped having w3 schools it explained a lot of what were supposed to do. 
It helped me understand how exactly to write the codes and the examples it gave me practice to work on my codes on my project, it definitely gave me the explaintion of problems I was stuck on.
HTML turned to be way easier than what I thought, I think whenever I get put with a new programming language, but this was easier than Java. 
The video Professor Meadows posted helped me get through the project and simplify how to connect Results and Index together, it helped making a README and it helped how we can push to GITHUB in a very easy and descriptive manner.
